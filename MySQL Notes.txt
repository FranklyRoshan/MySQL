SQL

	Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. 
	It allows users to perform tasks such as querying data, inserting new records, updating existing data, deleting 
	entries, and defining database structures. SQL is declarative, meaning users specify what data they want rather 
	than how to retrieve it. It is standardized by ANSI and ISO, though various vendors (like Oracle, Microsoft, 
	and MySQL) implement their own dialects (e.g., PL/SQL, T-SQL). SQL is fundamental in data analysis, application 
	development, and database administration.

MySQL

	The co-founders of MySQL AB are Michael "Monty" Widenius, David Axmark, and Allan Larsson.

	Michael Widenius is the main author of the MySQL database.
	The company was founded in 1995 to develop and promote the MySQL database.
	Widenius named MySQL after his daughter, My.

SQL 
	The default shortcut key to run SQL code in MySQL Workbench depends on your selection:

	To execute the entire script or selected portion, use Ctrl+Enter (or Command+Return on macOS).
	To execute the current statement (the statement where your cursor is placed), use Ctrl+Shift+Enter 
	(or Command+Shift+Return on macOS).
	These shortcuts are defined in the official MySQL Workbench documentation under the "Query Menu" section.
